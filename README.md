### Hi there 👋
I'm Maria (she/her)! 
![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=mgg39&style=for-the-badge&color=blueviolet)

### 📚 Background
I am an undergraduate Physics student at the University of Bath, who enjoys quantum algorithm design and implementations for Quantum Networking and Simulation systems.
Between 2021/2022 I completed and industrial year-long placement at Cisco's R&D Quantum Networking team. During the Summer 2022 I was a Google scholar for the Google Summer of code. At the moment I am a GitHub campus excel, with a strong interest in quantum tech.

### 👩‍💻 Research 
A lot of my work revolves around quantum networking. You can follow my readings in my Quantum-tech-papers repository.
I have worked in quantum protocol design and testing with Netsquid and Python.
I am also working on a quantum error correction library for Juia's QUantum Clifford tool.
I am working on a side by side comparison of quantum networks against classical networks based on various topological distributions.


### 👩‍💻 Code 
![Maria's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=mgg39&count_private=true&show_icons=true&theme=nightowl&hide=prs,contribs)

My top languages are: Python, C, Julia
I have experience using: Qiskit, Cirq, as well as various Quantum Discrete event simulators, such as Netsquid and SeQUeNCe. 
In my pinned repositories, you can find examples of my Quantum Discrete event simulations (Python) as well as my personal academic quantum paper library, and one of my projects based on multidimentional superconducting materials (C).
In terms of open source I have worked/contributed to the following repos:
