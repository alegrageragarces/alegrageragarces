### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Maria (she/her), I work as a Quantum develloper in Quantum Networking protocol design. My academic background is in Physics with a Bsc from the Univeristy of Bath. I enjoy working on quantum algorithm design and implementations for Quantum Networking and Simulation systems.
I currently work at Cisco's R&D Quantum development team, and will be participating in GSoC 2022 via the creation of a quantum error correction library.
