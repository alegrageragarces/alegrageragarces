### Hi there üëã

### üìö Background
I am Maria (she/her), a Quantum Informatics PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, with a passion for quantum software.
My career thus far looks a bit like this: 

2021/2022 industrial year-long placement at Cisco's R&D Quantum Networking team.

summer 2022 Google Summer of code

2023 GitHub campus expert at the University of Bath

2023-2024 IBM Quantum Intern


You can find my full on [LinkedIn][1].

### üìù Research 
My current research focuses on distributed quantum computing, and a lot of my previous work revolved around quantum networking. You can follow my readings in my Quantum-tech-papers repository.
I have worked in quantum protocol design and testing with Netsquid and Python, a quantum error correction library for Julia's QUantum Clifford tool, and side by side comparisons of quantum networks against classical networks based on various topological distributions.
At the moment I am experimenting with qiskit and error mitigation libraries.

Alongside my passion for quantum software, I am also currently working on my Bsc dissertation, which consists on Modelling of photon pair generation in dual-rail lithium niobate photonic nano-wire setup. This work is done alongside my project partner, under Dr. Andriy Gorbach and Dr. Peter Mosley at the University of Bath. The project will be completed by May 2024.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Code 
[![Maria's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=mgg39&hide_rank=true)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

My top languages are: Python, MATLAB, Julia & C.

I have experience using: Qiskit, as well as various Quantum Discrete event simulators, such as Netsquid and SeQUeNCe. 
In my pinned repositories, you can find examples of my Quantum Discrete event simulations (Python) as well as my personal academic quantum paper library, and one of my projects based on multidimentional superconducting materials (C).
In terms of open source I have worked/contributed to the following repos:
- SeQUeNCe: an open source Simulator of QUantum Network Communication that allows modeling of quantum networks including photonic network components, control protocols, and applications. that allows modeling of quantum networks including photonic network components, control protocols, and applications. 
- Quantum Universal Education: a community-driven, open-source educational website for learning about all aspects of quantum computing across the full stack, from hardware to algorithms.
- Qiskit: an open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of extended quantum circuits, operators, and algorithms. 
- QuantumClifford: a simulator of Clifford circuits, graph states, and other quantum Stabilizer formalism tools.
