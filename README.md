### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Maria (she/her), My academic background is in Physics with an ongoing BSc from the Univeristy of Bath. I enjoy working on quantum algorithm design and implementations for Quantum Networking and Simulation systems. I am currently participating in GSoC 2022 by building a quantum error correction library for Julia's Clifford circuit Quantum simulator.

I have experience using: Qiskit, Cirq, as well as various Quantum Discrete event simulators, such as Netsquid and SeQUeNCe. In my pinned repositories, you can find examples of my Quantum Discrete event simulations (Python) as well as my personal academic quantum paper library, and one of my projects based on multidimentional superconducting materials (C).
