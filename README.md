### Hi there üëã

### üìö Background
I am Maria (she/her), a Quantum Informatics PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, with a passion for quantum software.
My career thus far looks a bit like this: 

- 2019/2024 Bsc Physics at the University of Bath
- 2021/2022 industrial year-long placement at Cisco's R&D Quantum Networking team.
- 2022 Google Summer of code
- 2023 GitHub campus expert at the University of Bath
- 2023/2024 IBM Quantum Intern
- 2024/2028 PhD Quantum Informatics at the University of Edinburgh

You can find the full story on [LinkedIn][1].

### üìù Research 
My current research focuses on distributed quantum computing, under the supervision of Chris Heunen and Mahesh Marina.  
I've received a [Unitary Fund microgrant](https://unitary.foundation) and a [SandboxAQ Research Excellence Scholarship](https://www.sandboxaq.com/company/scholarships) for my work on distributed quantum software.  
I currently mantain a [blog on the topic of distributed quantum computing](https://grageragarces.github.io/dqc).  
Much of my earlier work revolved around quantum networking, including protocol design and simulation using NetSquid and Python, contributions to a quantum error correction library for Julia‚Äôs QuantumClifford, comparisons of quantum and classical networks across different topologies, and Qiskit use-case programming.  

Although I no longer update it, my Quantum-tech-papers repository provides a good snapshot of my early interests before I started my PhD.

I completed my BSc dissertation in 2024, which involved modelling photon pair generation in a dual-rail lithium niobate photonic nanowire setup. This work was supervised by Dr. Andriy Gorbach and Dr. Peter Mosley at the University of Bath, in collaboration with my project partner Christian Williams.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Code 
[![Maria's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=grageragarces&hide_rank=true)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

My top languages are: Python, MATLAB, Julia & C.

I have experience using: Qiskit, as well as various Quantum Discrete event simulators, such as Netsquid and SeQUeNCe. 
In my repositories, you can find examples of my Quantum Discrete event simulations (Python) as well as my personal academic quantum paper library, and one of my projects based on multidimentional superconducting materials (C).
In terms of open source I have worked/contributed to the following repos:
- SeQUeNCe: an open source Simulator of QUantum Network Communication that allows modeling of quantum networks including photonic network components, control protocols, and applications. that allows modeling of quantum networks including photonic network components, control protocols, and applications. 
- Quantum Universal Education: a community-driven, open-source educational website for learning about all aspects of quantum computing across the full stack, from hardware to algorithms.
- Qiskit: an open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of extended quantum circuits, operators, and algorithms. 
- QuantumClifford: a simulator of Clifford circuits, graph states, and other quantum Stabilizer formalism tools.
